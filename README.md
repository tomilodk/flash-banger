# flash-banger

I want to create a go client which I can download on windows and macos. Each client connects to a server also made in go, where an id for each clients are created. Then I want to call the server with a POST call where I define the client id. And a WHITE screen like a flash in csgo should appear and fade away again on the clients computer.
